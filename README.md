## Limitations![IMG_9502]()

This repository does not include the backend implementation or live demo URL for security reasons.

## How It Works
1. Volunteers log in and select their name to view assigned tasks.
2. They can update task statuses, add notes, or delete tasks.
3. New tasks can be assigned to volunteers, and reminders can be sent for pending tasks.
4. All updates are reflected in a central Google Sheet.
